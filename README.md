**Breast Cancer Prediction using SVM Classifier**


This project aims to predict breast cancer in patients using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with the scikit-learn library. The steps involved include data pre-processing, training the SVM classifier, assessing the model's correctness, and tuning hyperparameters for improved performance.


**Introduction**

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of breast cancer can significantly improve patient outcomes. In this project, we use machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient has breast cancer based on various features.

**Dependencies**

Python 3

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

**Data Pre-processing**

Data pre-processing involves handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. It ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training the SVM classifier.

**Training SVM Classifier**

We train an SVM classifier using the scikit-learn library to predict breast cancer in patients. SVM is a powerful algorithm suitable for binary classification tasks like this. We use the training data to fit the SVM model and make predictions on unseen testing data.

**Model Evaluation**

We assess the correctness of the SVM classifier by evaluating its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity (recall), specificity, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the classifier.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**

Hyperparameter tuning involves finding the best combination of hyperparameters for the SVM classifier to improve its performance. We use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to search for optimal hyperparameters that optimize the model's performance.
